✨ What is JLauncher?
JLauncher is a unified launcher for Java applications on Windows, built using Batch Script, PowerShell, and a touch of VBS for sound effects.
It provides a simple, user-friendly, graphical experience for selecting and running .jar files — no terminal knowledge required.
Perfect for:
- Users who don’t want to type commands
- Developers distributing Java apps
- Anyone who wants a clean, automated way to run .jar files

✨ Features
- 🖱️ Interactive .jar selection via graphical PowerShell dialog
- 🌎 Automatic bilingual support (Portuguese 🇧🇷 / English 🇺🇸)
- 🌐 Optional URL launcher (e.g., open http://localhost:8080 after startup)
- 💾 Persistent configuration (remembers last selected JAR, URL, and delay)
- 📜 Execution logs stored in launcher.log
- 🎨 Console animations, banners, and color effects
- 🛑 Robust error handling (missing Java, missing JAR, cancellation, etc.)
- 🔊 Sound effects using VBS scripts
- ⚙️ Multiple launch modes (-s, -m, -b, etc.)

💡 Why JLauncher?
Because not every user wants to type:
java -jar myapp.jar


And because Java apps deserve a friendly launcher, not a cryptic command line.
